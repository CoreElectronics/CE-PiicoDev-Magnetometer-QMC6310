This is the repo for the Core Electronics [PiicoDev Magnetometer QMC6310](https://core-electronics.com.au/catalog/product/view/sku/CE07937).

The PiicoDev® Magnetometer measures invisible magnetic fields. It's sensitive enough to use as a compass and wide-range enough for detecting magnets - which have a much stronger field. The on-board QMC6310 can measure 16-bits in ranges from 200μT to 3000μT in all 3 axes. By using PiicoDev adapters and cables, you can connect to this sensor without soldering - or use the standard breakout header if you prefer breadboard prototyping. Whichever you prefer, the PiicoDev guides will guide you through exciting experiments like measuring the Earth's magnetic field to find a heading and detecting if a magnet is nearby.

**Features**

- Small size, high accuracy
- Measures magnetic fields in 3-axes
- Sensitive enough to use like a compass, broad range enough to work with nearby magnets
- Great guides to get you started
- PiicoDev connector, compatible with Qwiic and STEMMA QT (3.3V only)
- 2.54mm breakout for breadboarding/prototyping
- Manufactured and supported in Australia by Core Electronics
